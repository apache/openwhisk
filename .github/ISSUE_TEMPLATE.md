We use the issue tracker for bugs and feature requests. For general questions and discussion please use http://slack.openwhisk.org/ or https://openwhisk.apache.org/contact.html instead.

Do NOT share passwords, credentials or other confidential information.

Before creating a new issue, please check if there is one already open that
fits the defect you are reporting.
If you open an issue and realize later it is a duplicate of a pre-existing
open issue, please close yours and add a comment to the other.

Issues can be created for either defects or enhancement requests. If you are a committer than please add the labels "bug" or "feature". If you are not a committer please make clear in the comments which one it is, so that committers can add these labels later.

If you are reporting a defect, please edit the issue description to include the
information shown below.

If you are reporting an enhancement request, please include information on what you are trying to achieve and why that enhancement would help you.
