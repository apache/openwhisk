    # If a request hasn't been responded to after the time period set here
    # a `akka.http.Timedout` message will be sent to the timeout handler.
    # Set to `infinite` to completely disable request timeouts.
    #
    # Explaining the set value:
    # The controller holds connections up to 60s for blocking invokes, and
    # all other operations are expected to complete quickly. We allow a grace
    # period in addition to the blocking invoke timeout.
    request-timeout = 65s

    # The maximum number of concurrently accepted connections when using the
    # `Http().bindAndHandle` methods.
    #
    # This setting doesn't apply to the `Http().bind` method which will still
    # deliver an unlimited backpressured stream of incoming connections.
    #
    # Note, that this setting limits the number of the connections on a best-effort basis.
    # It does *not* strictly guarantee that the number of established TCP connections will never
    # exceed the limit (but it will be approximately correct) because connection termination happens
    # asynchronously. It also does *not* guarantee that the number of concurrently active handler
    # flow materializations will never exceed the limit for the reason that it is impossible to reliably
    # detect when a materialization has ended.
    max-connections = 8192

    # Description:
    # Enables/disables support for statistics collection and querying.
    # Even though stats keeping overhead is small,
    # for maximum performance switch off when not needed.
    stats-support = off

    # Description:
    # The time after which an idle connection will be automatically closed.
    # Set to `infinite` to completely disable idle connection timeouts.
    #
    # Explaining the set value:
    # This must be greater than the request timeout.
    idle-timeout = 70s

    # Description:
    # Enables/disables automatic handling of HEAD requests.
    # If this setting is enabled the server dispatches HEAD requests as GET
    # requests to the application and automatically strips off all message
    # bodies from outgoing responses.
    # Note that, even when this setting is off the server will never send
    # out message bodies on responses to HEAD requests.
    # Default value today is on, hence need to explicitly set this to off
    transparent-head-requests = off
