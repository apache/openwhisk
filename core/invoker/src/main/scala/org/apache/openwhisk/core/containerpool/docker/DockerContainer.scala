   *
   * For warm containers, the container log file already holds output from
   * previous activations that have to be skipped. For this reason, a starting position
   * is kept and updated upon each invocation.
   *
   * There are two possible modes controlled by parameter waitForSentinel:
   *
   * 1. Wait for sentinel:
   *    Tail container log file until two sentinel markers show up. Complete
   *    once two sentinel markers have been identified, regardless whether more
   *    data could be read from container log file.
   *    A log file reading error is reported if sentinels cannot be found.
   *    Managed action runtimes use the the sentinels to mark the end of
   *    an individual activation.
   *
   * 2. Do not wait for sentinel:
   *    Read container log file up to its end. Stop reading once the end
   *    has been reached. Complete once two sentinel markers have been
   *    identified, regardless whether more data could be read from
   *    container log file.
   *    No log file reading error is reported if sentinels cannot be found.
   *    Blackbox actions do not necessarily produce marker sentinels properly,
   *    so this mode is used for all blackbox actions.
   *    In addition, this mode can / should be used in error situations with
   *    managed action runtimes where sentinel markers may be missing or
   *    arrive too late - Example: action exceeds time or memory limit during
   *    init or run.
   *
   * The result returned from this method does never contain any log sentinel markers. These are always
   * filtered - regardless of the specified waitForSentinel mode.
   *
   * Only parses and returns as much logs as fit in the passed log limit. Stops log collection with an error
   * if processing takes too long or time gaps between processing individual log lines are too long.
