/**
 * A pool managing containers to run actions on.
 *
 * This pool fulfills the other half of the ContainerProxy contract. Only
 * one job (either Start or Run) is sent to a child-actor at any given
 * time. The pool then waits for a response of that container, indicating
 * the container is done with the job. Only then will the pool send another
 * request to that container.
 *
 * Upon actor creation, the pool will start to prewarm containers according
 * to the provided prewarmConfig, iff set. Those containers will **not** be
 * part of the poolsize calculation, which is capped by the poolSize parameter.
 * Prewarm containers are only used, if they have matching arguments
 * (kind, memory) and there is space in the pool.
 *
 * @param childFactory method to create new container proxy actor
 * @param feed actor to request more work from
 * @param prewarmConfig optional settings for container prewarming
 * @param poolConfig config for the ContainerPool
