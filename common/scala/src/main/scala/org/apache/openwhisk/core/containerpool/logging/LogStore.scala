/**
 * Interface to gather logs after the activation, define their way of storage and fetch them from that storage upon
 * user request.
 *
 * Lifecycle wise, log-handling runs through two steps:
 * 1. Collecting logs after an activation has run to store them in the database.
 * 2. Fetching logs from the API to use them (as a user).
 *
 * Both of those lifecycle steps can independently implemented via {@code collectLogs} and {@code fetchLogs}
 * respectively.
 *
 * The implementation can choose to not fetch logs at all but use the underlying container orchestrator to handle
 * log-storage/forwarding (via {@code containerParameters}). In this case, {@code collectLogs} would be implemented
 * as a stub, only returning a line of log hinting that logs are stored elsewhere. {@code fetchLogs} though can
 * implement the API of the backend system to be able to still show the logs of a specific activation via the OpenWhisk
 * API.
