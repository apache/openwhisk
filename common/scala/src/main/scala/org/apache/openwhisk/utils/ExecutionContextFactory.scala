   * Makes an execution context for Futures using Executors.newCachedThreadPool. From the javadoc:
   *
   * Creates a thread pool that creates new threads as needed, but will reuse previously constructed threads
   * when they are available. These pools will typically improve the performance of programs that execute many
   * short-lived asynchronous tasks. Calls to execute will reuse previously constructed threads if available.
   * If no existing thread is available, a new thread will be created and added to the pool. Threads that have
   * not been used for sixty seconds are terminated and removed from the cache. Thus, a pool that remains idle
   * for long enough will not consume any resources. Note that pools with similar properties but different details
   * (for example, timeout parameters) may be created using ThreadPoolExecutor constructors.
