/**
 * Enables batching of a type T.
 *
 * Batches are being created using a maximum batchSize. If there is back-pressure (concurrency is
 * maxed out and it is waiting for the operations to complete) a batch will be build up and
 * then handled accordingly. Batching will only happen under back-pressure so there is no latency
 * being traded off for batching in a non back-pressured case.
 *
 * The given concurrency controls how many batches are handled in parallel. (example: How many
 * batches of records are written to the database in parallel.)
 *
 * The operation-function takes a batch of T and does something to it that results in a sequence
 * of the same size of the batch. (example: Writing a batch of database records results in a sequence
 * of database responses). These results will be assigned to the relevant element in the batch.
 * (example: Putting a database record in batches will give you the database response for each record
 * respectively)
 *
 * @param batchSize maximum size of a batch
 * @param concurrency number of batches being handled in parallel
 * @param operation operation taking the batch
 * @tparam T the type to be batched
 * @tparam R return type of a single element after operation
