/**
 * A method for sending Active Acknowledgements (aka "active ack") messages to the load balancer. These messages
 * are either completion messages for an activation to indicate a resource slot is free, or result-forwarding
 * messages for continuations (e.g., sequences and conductor actions).
 *
 * The activation result is always provided because some acknowledgement messages may not carry the result of
 * the activation and this is needed for sending user events.
 *
 * @param tid the transaction id for the activation
 * @param activationResult is the activation result
 * @param blockingInvoke is true iff the activation was a blocking request
 * @param controllerInstance the originating controller/loadbalancer id
 * @param userId is the UUID for the namespace owning the activation
 * @param acknowledgement the acknowledgement message to send
