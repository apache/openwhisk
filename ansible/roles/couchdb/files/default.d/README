CouchDB default configuration files

Files found under the etc/default.d directory that end with .ini are
parsed within couchdb(1) at startup.

This directory is intended for distribution-specific overrides of
CouchDB defaults. Package maintainers should be placing overrides in
this directory.

System administrator should place overrides in the etc/local.d directory
instead.
