CouchDB local configuration files

Files found under the etc/local.d directory that end with .ini are parsed
within couchdb(1) at startup.

This directory is intended for system administrator overrides of CouchDB
defaults. Package maintainers should be placing overrides in the
etc/default.d directory instead.
